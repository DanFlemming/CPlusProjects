This is a fight stimulator program that you can either create a new player or chose from the ones i have created. 
Use this by following the directions that get presented, pretty straight forward.
When you defeat other people you will gain extras such as health bars and you will get experience for ther strenght and speed.
unfortunally i had to settle with punches and kicks, ect due to timing, i wanted to add weapons and shields along with it and make the enemies into a child class but i ran out of time to tinker around.
//my compiler is the command line with wingw and i use sublime text to write.

Enjoy your summer and goodluck with your next semester teaching!!
